## Features
- Create, move, and resize clips directly on the waveform
- Global Play/Pause and per-clip Play/Pause, with an accurate playhead
- Single‚Äëclick seek anywhere on the waveform or inside a clip
- Export each clip to MP3 (preserves channels up to stereo, sensible bitrate)
- Download all clips at once as a ZIP archive
 - Spec-compliant filenames and dynamic numbering
- Runs entirely in your browser (no uploads, no accounts, no tracking)

## How to use
1. Click ‚ÄúChoose File‚Äù and pick an audio file.
2. Drag across the waveform to create a clip.
3. Drag inside a clip to move it, or drag its edges to resize.
4. Use Play/Pause/Stop globally or per clip; the playhead shows the current position.
5. Click ‚ÄúDownload‚Äù on any clip to export it as MP3, or ‚ÄúDownload All‚Äù to get a ZIP of all clips.

### Filenames
- Clips are named using the original file name and clip metadata:
  `<Original Filename>---clip-<NN>-<HH.MM.SS.mmm>-<HH.MM.SS.mmm>-<DD.DD>.mp3`
  - `NN`: clip number based on current ordering by start time (00-padded)
  - `HH.MM.SS.mmm`: start and end times, zero‚Äëpadded, dots as separators
  - `DD.DD`: duration in seconds with 2 decimals
  - Example: `Kickback Trailer---clip-01-00.00.37.181-00.02.44.004-126.82.mp3`
- ZIP archive name: `<Original Filename>---clips.zip`.

### UI time display
- Start/end in the list show as `HH:MM:SS:CC` (centiseconds).
- After the range, you‚Äôll see colon markers representing duration: one colon per 15s, up to 10. On small screens only one colon is shown.
